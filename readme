Mini Instruction for Zhenny:
Frist you should create a Virtual Enviroment by typing 'python3 -m venv venv' in the terminal
Once Virtual Enviroment is generated run 'source venv/bin/activate' to start up venv
Once Virtual Enviroment is up you can run 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' to install dependencies 
After everything has been installed type 'python3 main.py' to run program
if you wish to deactivate your Virtual Enviroment run 'deactivate'

If all else fails ask Thila. <3
